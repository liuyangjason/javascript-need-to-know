# Introduction
this is one simple blog to describe what must to learn when using javascript.

# Editor
you must select one source code editor. there are multiples of choices. And I list what i like:
1.  [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) : it is one simple on line code editor. i recommend using it if you only want to write simple javascript snippet and show the result at once. If you are from JAVA world and you should be familiar with __Scratches__ feature used in IntelliJ IDEA. Yes, they are analogous features.
2. [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) : it is another version on line javascript code editor. You can use it as the replacement of jsbin.
3. __VSCode__ : it is one of the best code editor (not on line editor). I recommend it stronly. 

# Naming Convention
I recommend using airbnb style. it is here: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

# Running Environment Setup
If you do not use __jsbin__ or __jsfiddle__ to show result of javascript snippet , you should set up local environment.  

I recommend python. it is built-in tool in Macbook. And it is super easy to install on Windows system.
~~~ Python
cd <directory-of-your-javascript-files>
# if python version is above 3.X
python -m http.server 
# if python version is above 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
~~~


After setting up your local environment, it is time to write your javascript snippet and show how it works!
